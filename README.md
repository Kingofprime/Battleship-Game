# Battleship-Game
Battleship w/ Abilities:

This is a C++ program that implements a game of battleship. The program allows two players to play against each other, or one player against the computer.

All the files necessary to run the program should already be included. 

To run the program , unzip the provided folder to a known location. Within the folder, open the “Battleship.sln” file in Microsoft Visual Studio. simply open the project and press the 'Local Windows Debugger' button at the top. 

The program will prompt you to choose between player vs player or player vs CPU. After you decide you will then be prompted to either place ships manually or randomly. After ships have been placed the game will begin, and player(s) just have to follow directions on the screen to attack and use abilities.

Player(s) can also modify parts of the game such as board size, amount of ships, starting points and costs of abilities by going into 'parameters.h' file. It is important to make these changes before starting the program.

If an incorrect value is entered there is no way to go back, such as accidentally choosing 5 instead of 4 (confirm hit) when attacking. If this occurs restart the program.

To review your run of the project , go to Project 2 folder and open the output.txt file.
